**Q3: Walk me through the RAG pipeline from user query to final response.**

- Expected Answer:
  1. User submits query →
  2. Generate query embedding →
  3. Perform vector similarity search →
  4. Retrieve top-k relevant chunks →
  5. Build context prompt with retrieved content →
  6. Send to OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo →
  7. Extract citations and return response

### Technical Implementation

**Q41: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**

- Expected Answer: Supervised learning uses labeled data (input-output pairs), while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Our embedding models use supervised learning, while clustering for community detection is unsupervised.

**Q42: What is overfitting and how do you prevent it?**

- Expected Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data but fails on new data. We prevent it through techniques like regularization, dropout, cross-validation, and using pre-trained models like OpenAI's embeddings.

**Q43: What is the difference between training, validation, and test sets?**

- Expected Answer: Training set trains the model, validation set tunes hyperparameters, test set evaluates final performance. We use this concept when evaluating our search relevance and tag suggestion accuracy.

### LLM-Specific Concepts

**Q44: What is a token in the context of LLMs?**

- Expected Answer: A token is the basic unit of text processing, roughly equivalent to a word or subword. GPT models have token limits (4096 for GPT-3.5-turbo), which affects our RAG context window management.

**Q45: What is temperature in LLM generation?**

- Expected Answer: Temperature controls randomness in text generation. Lower values (0.1-0.3) produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (0.7-1.0) increase creativity. We use low temperature for consistent responses.

**Q46: What is top-k sampling?**

- Expected Answer: Top-k sampling limits the model to choose from only the k most likely next tokens. We might use top-k=40 to balance coherence and diversity in AI-generated content.

**Q47: What is top-p (nucleus) sampling?**

- Expected Answer: Top-p sampling chooses from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p. It's more dynamic than top-k, adapting to the probability distribution at each step.

**Q48: What is a frequency penalty in LLM generation?**

- Expected Answer: Frequency penalty reduces the likelihood of repeating tokens based on their frequency in the generated text. We use it to prevent repetitive AI responses in our context menu and chatbot.

**Q49: What is a presence penalty?**

- Expected Answer: Presence penalty reduces the likelihood of repeating any token that has already appeared, regardless of frequency. It encourages topic diversity in generated content.

### Vector and Embedding Concepts

**Q50: What is the curse of dimensionality?**

- Expected Answer: As dimensions increase, data becomes sparse and distance metrics become less meaningful. Our 1536-dimensional embeddings are designed to mitigate this through careful training and dimensionality optimization.

**Q51: What are different distance metrics for vectors?**

- Expected Answer: Cosine similarity (angle between vectors), Euclidean distance (straight-line distance), Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences). We use cosine similarity for semantic similarity.

**Q52: What is dimensionality reduction and when would you use it?**

- Expected Answer: Techniques like PCA or t-SNE reduce vector dimensions while preserving important information. We might use it for visualizing embeddings or reducing storage costs for large-scale deployments.

**Q53: What is the difference between dense and sparse vectors?**

- Expected Answer: Dense vectors have values in most dimensions (like our embeddings), while sparse vectors have mostly zeros (like TF-IDF). Dense vectors capture semantic meaning better for our use cases.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

**Q54: What is k-means clustering and how does it work?**

**Q55: What is the PageRank algorithm?**

- Expected Answer: PageRank measures node importance in a graph based on incoming links and their quality. We implement it to identify important pages in our knowledge graph, helping prioritize search results.

**Q56: What is cosine similarity and why is it useful for text?**

- Expected Answer: Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors, ignoring magnitude. It's perfect for text because document length doesn't affect semantic similarity - a short and long document about the same topic should be similar.

**Q57: What is TF-IDF?**

- Expected Answer: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weights terms by their frequency in a document vs. their rarity across all documents. We use it in our hybrid search to complement semantic search.

### Deep Learning Concepts

### Data Processing

**Q70: What is data normalization and why is it important?**

- Expected Answer: Scaling data to similar ranges (0-1 or standard normal). Important for neural networks to train effectively. We normalize text before embedding generation.

**Q71: What is tokenization?**

- Expected Answer: Breaking text into smaller units (tokens) for processing. Different strategies include word-level, subword (BPE), or character-level. Critical for our text processing pipeline.

**Q72: What is stemming vs lemmatization?**

- Expected Answer: Stemming removes word endings (running → run), lemmatization finds root forms (better → good). We might use these for text preprocessing in search.

**Q73: What are stop words?**

- Expected Answer: Common words (the, and, is) that often don't carry semantic meaning. We might filter them during text processing, though modern embeddings handle them well.
